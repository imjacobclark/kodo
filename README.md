# Kodo

Kodo is a service that measures your coding activity. It measures how long you've spent in each file/project/language and reports it back at regular intervals so you can quantify your coding activity. 

Kodo requires installation in your IDE as an extension, this extension sends heartbeat stats back to an endpoint and stores them to be queried later. In theory, Kodo could support any software application that is able to send stats in a particular format, e.g Google Chrome.

Kodo is built on serverless technologies using Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), meaning you can easily depoy this to your own infrastructure if you fancy!
