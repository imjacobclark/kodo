# Kodo

Kodo is a service that quantifies your software usage. It measures how long you've spent in a piece of software and reports it back at regular intervals so you can quantify your usage. 

Most often Kodo will require installation in your software as an extension or plugin, this extension sends heartbeat stats back to an API and stores them to be queried later. 

Kodo is able to support any software application that is able to send stats in a particular format. It 

Kodo is built on serverless technologies using Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), meaning you can easily depoy this to your own infrastructure if you fancy!

## Develop, Build & Deploy

### Extensions

Each extension has its own README on how to to build and deploy, see the `extensions` directory for the full list of supported extensions.

### Infrastructure

Kodos infrastructure takes care of much of the business logic, it is fully event driven and fully serverless via AWS SAM. It can be developed and deployed as a separate entity, see the `infrastructure` directory for full instructions.

### Web

Kodas website is built and deployed independently of the rest of the infrastructure, it is AWS Amplify which takes care of all the heavy lifting. Web calls out to the infrastructure to gather data. See the `web` directory for full instructions.
