# Kodo

Kodo is a service that measures your coding activity. It measures how long you've spent in each file/project/language and reports it back at regular intervals so you can quantify your coding activity. 

Kodo requires installation in your IDE as an extension, this extension sends heartbeat stats back to an endpoint and stores them to be queried later. In theory, Kodo could support any software application that is able to send stats in a particular format, e.g Google Chrome.

Kodo is built on serverless technologies using Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), meaning you can easily depoy this to your own infrastructure if you fancy!

## Develop, Build & Deploy

### Extensions

Each extension has its own README on how to to build and deploy, see the `extensions` directory for the full list of supported extensions.

### Infrastructure

Kodos infrastructure takes care of much of the business logic, it is fully event driven and fully serverless via AWS SAM. It can be developed and deployed as a separate entity, see the `infrastructure` directory for full instructions.

### Web

Kodas website is built and deployed independently of the rest of the infrastructure, it is AWS Amplify which takes care of all the heavy lifting. Web calls out to the infrastructure to gather data. See the `web` directory for full instructions.

## Disclosure 

Kodo captures the following data and ships it off to Amazon.

* Your workspaces folder name
* Your elapsed time within these files/folders
